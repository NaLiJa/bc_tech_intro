# The Blockchain Data Structure

Recall from the [Introduction](./bc_proto_intro.md) that the term blockchain can refer to at least three different concepts, one of them being the core data structure that is used to implement the distributed ledgers. In this article we look at this data structure.

The main challenge one has to contend with when designing a data structure to contain the transactions in a distributed ledger is that each node will have its own local copy of the data structure and hence be free to modify it. So there needs to be mechanisms to ensure that nodes maintain a view of the ledger that is consistent across the network. This view of the ledger includes both the contents of the transactions and the order in which these transactions were executed.

The solution that the blockchain technology offers to this problem comes in the form of the blockchain data-structure and the [blockchain consensus algorithm](/bc_proto_consensus_algorithm.md). These two play off of each other to set up a protocol and incentive mechanism to ensure that the nodes are honest in terms of the contents and ordering of the transactions.

In particular, the blockchain data-structure ensures that

**A.**  it is computationally (see note) very expensive to create it

**B.**  it is computationally very expensive to modify entries without violating , with the cost increasing linearly with the age of an entry

**C.** it is computationally cheap to verify that a structure is a valid blockchain data structure.

The full utility of these will not become fully clear until after we have had a chance to study the consensus algorithm. However, right out of the gate we can see that the properties **C** and **B** together imply that once created, it will be very expensive to tamper with a blockchain without getting caught. Indeed, the difficulty can be adjusted as needed and the bigger the ledger is and older the transaction, the more infeasible it becomes. These properties support the so called [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) based conensus algorithm that we will discuss [later](bc_proto_consensus_algorithm.md). The proof of work here refers to the fact that the creation of the block enodes proof that a certain amount of work was carried out when creating the block. 

> Note: In general there are measures of cost other than computational cost that can be used when constructing a blockchain, like reputation or stake in the consistency of the blockchain. These latter are particularly important from, for instance, a sustainbility point of view and we discuss them [here](bc_proto_final_words.md). Consensus algorithms based on that are variously called called Proof of Reuputation or Proof of Stake based consensus. 

At a high level, the blockchain is a [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) where each item in the list is _block_ and the links have some constraints that depend on the contents of the block. In the following we first describe what is contained in each block and then describe how these blocks are chained together. Along the way, we use python-like pseudo-code to make the ideas concrete, and refer to python implementations of the same ideas for detailed self-study later on.


## Blocks

The purpose of a block is to store a set of transactions, their ordering, and some additional information to ensure properties **A** to **C**. Each block holds the same number of transactions, and this number is a user parameter. The transactions within a block are ordered, and this ordering together with the ordering of the blocks in the blockchain determine the ordering of the transactions in the distributed ledger as a whole.  At a high level, each block consists of two components (see _Figure: Blockchain Basic_):

1. a block header 
2. the transactions in the block

The block header, in turn, contains

1. the block id
2. pointer to the transactions in the block
3. pointer  to the previous block in the chain
4. timestamp for the block creation
5. a nonce/solution to a [cryptographic puzzle](./bc_proto_prelim.md#cryptographic-puzzles) and the difficulty level of the puzzle; the purpose of these two is to satisfy properties **A** to **C** above.

We quickly define each of the elements in turn. The block id is in the form a _block hash_ a string that uniquely identifies the block and is also [thumbprint](./bc_proto_prelim.md#uniqueness-of-hash-functions) of its contents. The pointer to the transactions is the hash-string of the root node of a Merkel tree (see below) Â used to store the transactions in a block (this is the next topic in our sequence). The pointer to the previous block is the block hash of the previous block in the chain. The timestamp is just a standard timestamp. We define how the nonce and the difficulty levels are when we describe how the block is created.

We now describe how a block is created.

### The Simplified Block

As we mentioned above, the transactions in a block are stored in a Merkel tree. Since this is an interesting data structure in its own right, to keep the length of this article reasonable, we will look at a simplified version of a block where instead of a Merkel tree we use an array to store the transactions. The pointer to the transactions will be a hash of a concatenation of the elements of this array. We discuss Merkel trees and full version of the block in the [next article](./bc_proto_merkel_tree.md).


The following pseuodecode illustrates this:
```C
struct BlockHeader:
    block_hash: str
    transactions_hash: str
    prev_block_hash: str
    timestamp: DateTime
    difficulty: nat
    nonce: str


struct BlockSimple:
    block_header: BlockHeader
    transactions: [str]
```
We now look at how this simplified block is created.

### Creating a Simplified Block

The pseduocode for the creation is given below, and a  python implementation is [here](../blockchain_proto/blockchain_ds.py). 
```python
def create_block(transactions: [str],
                 prev_block_hash: str,
                 difficulty: nat) -> Block:

    trans_hash = get_trans_hash(transactions)
    timestamp = get_cur_time()
    nonce = solve_block_puzzle(trans_hash, 
                               prev_block_hash, 
                               timestamp,
                               difficulty)
    block_hash = create_block_hash(trans_hash,
                                   prev_block_hash,
                                   timestamp,
                                   difficulty
                                   nonce)
    new_block_header = BlockHeader(block_hash,
                                   trans_hash,
                                   prev_block_hash,
                                   timestamp,
                                   difficulty,
                                   nonce)
    return BlockSimple(new_block_hash, transactions)
```
The `create_block()` expects the list of transactions, the hash of the previous block, and the difficulty level as inputs. The previous block hash will be some fixed string if the block is the first in the chain. 

The first line of the code creates a hash of the transaciton by calling a function and this lookes looks like the following:
```python
def get_trans_hash(transactions) -> str:
    return hash(contatenate(transactions))
```
That is it simply concatenates all the transactions in the list and then hashes the concatenated string to get the final hash.

The second line of `create_block()` gets the current timestamp by calling a standard library function.

The third line of `create_block()` calculates the nonce for a cryptographic puzzle and it looks as follows:
```python
def solve_block_puzzle(trans_hash: str, 
                       prev_block_hash: str, 
                       timestamp: DateTime, 
                       difficulty: nat) -> str:

    puzzle_string = contatenate(trans_hash, 
                                prev_block_hash, 
                                str(timestamp),
                                str(difficulty)
                                )
    return solve_puzzle(puzzle_string, difficulty)
```
The first line of the `solve_block_puzzle()` creates a _puzzle string_ which is a concatenatation of the transactions hash, the previous block hash and the timestamp converted to a string. The second line then calls the function defined [here](./bc_proto_prelim.md#cryptographic-puzzles) to get the solution to the the puzzle string. Some authors call the puzzle string the _preliminary block header_ which to me seems like incorrect terminology. Regardless, _this puzzle string will form the basis of guranteeing that propreties **A** - **C** are maintained_. 
> Hence, this step is the **proof of work** that is created when creating a block. This is also what is meant by **mining a block**, a term which you likely have read/heard about often

This process is illustrated in Figure: _Create Nonce_.

Continuing on with `create_block()`, the fourth line of the function creates the block hash by calling `create_block_hash()`, which is quite straightforward.
```python
def create_block_hash(trans_hash: str,
                      prev_block_hash: str,
                      timestamp: DateTime,
                      difficulty: nat 
                      nonce: str) -> str:
    block_data_string = contatenate(trans_hash, 
                                    prev_block_hash, 
                                    str(timestamp),
                                    str(difficulty),
                                    nonce)
    return hash(block_data_string)
```
It simply concatenates all the inputs, which consists of all the data in the block header, except for the block-hash, into a single string and creates a hash of that. So the block-hash serves as the thumbprint of the data in the block header. Since the block header also contains the hash of the transactions, the block hash serves as a thumbprint of the block as a whole, and also its id. This is shown in Figure: _Create Block Hash_

The last two lines of `create_block()` creates the block header and the block by calling the respective constructors, and then returns the created block. The final created simplifed block is illustrated in Figure: _Simplified Block Created_.

## The Blockchain Data Structure

In this section we look at how we can chain together a set of blocks so that **any tampering with the data in one of the blocks is either very difficult or can be detected very quickly**. This will turn out to be, in essence, the blockchain data structure. Indeed, the blockchain is meant to be an immutable structure and only addtion operations are supported. In the following, we wil first discuss how to add transactions (and hence blocks) to the blockchain and then go into how tampering (removing or altering blocks/transactions) is made difficult. 

### Data Structure Components

The blockchain data structure conists of
1. the hash of the latest block in the chain,
2. a dictionary/map that maps block hashes to blocks
2. a set of transactions that has not been added to the block as of yet
3. a constant parameter indicating the number of transactions per block.
4. A difficulty level for the blockchain data structure

This is illustrated in the pseudocode below.
```C
struct Blockchain:
    latest_block_hash: str
    block_hash_to_block_map: dictionary{str -> BlockSimple}
    current_transactions: [str]
    trans_per_block: const nat
    difficulty: nat

```
The length of `current_transactions` must always be less than `trans_per_block`.

### Initialization

Initializing the data structure is very simple. It starts with a

```python
def init_blockchain(trans_per_block: nat, difficulty_level: nat):
    return Blockchain(last_block = NULL)
```

### Adding A New Block

A new block is added to the chain as part of adding a new transaction to the blockchain. The pseudocode below describes this.

```python
def add_transaction(bc: Blockchain, transaction: str) -> BlockSimple:
    append(bc.current_transactions, transaction)
    if length(bc.current_transactions) < bc.trans_per_block:
        return NULL

    # bc.transaction_list == bc.trans_per_block t
    # time to create a new block
    
    # create the intermediate header for the new block
    new_block = create_block(bc.current_transactions, 
                             bc.latest_block_hash, 
                             bc.difficulty)
    bc.block_map[new_block.block_header.block_hash] = new_block
    bc.latest_block_hash = new_block.block_header.block_hash
    bc.transaction_list = []
    return new_block
```
The pseudocode for adding transactions is very simple. The transaction is first added to the the blockchain list of transactions. After that if the length of the the current transaction list is equal to the `trans_per_block` parameter, a new block is added. 

The new block is created by using the function `create_block()`. Once this new block is created, the `block_hash_to_block_map` and the `latest_block_hash` attributes of the block are upadted to, respectively, include the new block and set to the block hash of the latest block. Finally, the `current_transactions` of the blockchain are reset. 

The figure below illustrates this 
<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/blockchain_created.png" />
</p>
<figcaption align = "center"><b> Figure: The blockchain structure created.</b></figcaption>


In the following we discuss how the above data structure resists tampering.

## Tampering is Detectable or Expensive

Consider what happens if an unscrupulosous actor tries to modify the blockchain or their own benefit by tampering with the data in the blockchain. That is, the actor changes one or more of the following
- content of one of more transactions in a block
- the ordering of the transactions within a block 
- the timestamp of one or more  blocks
- changes linkage structure of the blockchain by changing the previous block hash within one or more block headers.

By the [uniqueness of the hash functions](), since all of these go into creating the block hash in `create_block()`, re-computing the block hash (which is not expensive) will immediately reveal the tampering. So any kind of simple attempt at tampering is detectable.

A slightly less simple way to tamper would be to recompute the block hash using the tampered data, and then update the block hash for the block(s) as well after tampering. However, this can also be detected cheaply calculating the puzzle string in  `solve_block_puzzle()` and checking that the nonce in block [solves this puzzle](./bc_proto_prelim.md#cryptographic-puzzles) for the difficulty level included in the block. As discussed in the linked article, any tampering will result in the nonce failing the check. Figure Transaction Tampering Flow illustrates how tampering with a single transaction impacts the nonce and henc makes it detectable - compare this with Figre _Simplified Block_

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/flow_of_wrongness_trans.png"/>
</p>
<figcaption align = "center"><b> Figure: Tampering With A Single Transaction.</b></figcaption>


So to tamper with a single block in an undetectable way, our tamperer would need to recalculate the nonce as well, which is very computationally expensive (with the expense determined by the difficulty of the puzzle). So essentially, the tamperer would need to create a new block by calling `create_block()` and then replace the current block with the new block.

However, the troubles for our tamperer does not end here. This new block would have a different block hash, which would be linked to by the preceding block in the chain. This means that the tampering would be detected by traversing the chain when the `prev_block_hash` of the previous block would point to a non-existant block. To fix this, the `prev_block_hash` would need to be changed and, by the same arguments as above, the preceding block would also have to be recreated. Indeed this process would need to be repeated until the latest latest block in the chain. 

To summarize, 

>to tamper with a single transaction in a single block in an undetectable way, all the blocks from that block to the latest will have to be recreated, which makes tampering extremely expensive. And all this together, ensures properties **A** to **C** of a blockchain.

The pseudocode below shows the logic for verifying a blockchain and detecting any tampering that we just discussed. 

```python
def validate_puzzle(block: BlockHeader, trans_hash: str) -> Bool:
    puzzle_string = contatenate(trans_hash, 
                                bh.prev_block_hash, 
                                str(bh.timestamp),
                                str(bh.difficulty))
    return check_solution(puzzle_string, 
                          bh.difficulty,
                          bh.nonce)

def validate_block_hash(bh: BlockHeader, trans_hash: str) -> Bool:
    test_block_hash = create_block_hash(trans_hash,
                                        bh.prev_block_hash,
                                        bh.timestamp,
                                        bh.difficulty,
                                        bh.nonce)


def validate_chain(bc: Blockchain) -> (Bool, str):
    next_block_hash = bc.last_block_hash
    block_count = 0

    while next_block_hash !=  NULL:

        block = bc.block_map[next_block_hash]
        if block is NULL:
            error_message = "Block not found for block hash: " + next_block_hash
            return (False, error_message)

        trans_hash = create_trans_hash(current_block.transactions)
        if not validate_puzzle(block.block_header, trans_hash):
            error_message = "Nonce invalid for block with block hash:" + 
                           block.block_hash
            return (False, error_message)

        if not validate_block_hash(block.block_header, trans_hash):
            error_message = "block hash is invalid: " + block.block_header.block_hash
            return (False, error_message)

        next_block_hash = current_block.prev_block_hash

        # increment block count for validation later
        block_count = block_count + 1

    if block_count != length(bc.block_hasht_to_block_map):
        error_message = "Chain traversal did not reach all the blocks"
        return (False, error_message)

    return (True, "Validation successful")
```
