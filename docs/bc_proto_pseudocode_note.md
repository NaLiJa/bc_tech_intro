# A Note on The Pseudocode

All the algorithms and data structures in these articles are written in pseudocode, with pointers to the actual implementation done in python. In writing these series of articles, I had to make a choice about how to write the pseudocode. On the one hand I wanted the documentation to be as programming language agnostic as possible, while on the other I do not want there to be too much of a jump when going from pseudocode to the actual code.

So what I arrived at was a mish-mash of python looking function definitions and C style data structures (so no classes) but with python syntax (!). The pseudocode style is procedural because it is more generic - while the python code is object oriented.  

In choosing the pseudocode syntax I have tried to use what I find most appealing about either - but I am not sure if I have arrived at the best of both worlds, or the worst - I would be interested in hearing from the reader if this works for them!
