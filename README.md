# A Technical Introduction To Blockchain

The articles and code in this repo gives a technical introduction to the core ideas of the blockchain technology. The repo is meant to be a resource that a programmer would find useful when learning about this blockchains. The documentation covers only at a *high level* what blockchains are and their purpose, but takes an *in depth* look into how they are implemented under the hood.

As part of the in depth look, we give a pseudo-code describing the  main procedures involved in creating and running a blockchain, and also give a executable implementation of a proto-blockchain which can be run on a single or multiple machines. It is a proto-blockchain because it lacks many features like security, scalability etc. necessary for real applications. Indeed, it is purely for pedagogical purposes, but has the basic components that you are likely to see in a full fledged blockchain platform like Ethereum. We chose python as the implementation language partly because of its popularity and simplicity - and partly because I am a researcher/practitioner in AI, where python is the language of choice!

Â > **About the reader:** We will assume the reader a) knows/enjoys programming, b) is familiar with some standard computer science (CS) technologies like public/private key cryptography, peer to peer systems etc. and c) prefers to understand things by building them. If you are not such a reader, there are better resources out there for you. An example is the book [1], which we are using as a starting point and reference for this work. Another recent exhaustive article is [2]. But of course, you are welcome to follow along for as long as it suits you. But please be warned that if something is a standard piece of CS tech, I will use it without further explanation (but will also try to link to a source that we feel is authoritative).


## Documentation Guide

The rest of the documentation is divided into the following parts:

- [**Blockchain Quick Introduction**](./docs/bc_proto_quick_intro.md) A quick introduction to the basic ideas of blockchain at a high level. 

- [**Preliminaries**](./docs/bc_proto_prelim.md) Some prelimanry topics around hash functions that play an important role in blockchains.

- [**The Blockchain Data Structure**](./docs/bc_proto_blockchain_ds.md) An introduction to the basic components of the blockchain data structure, why they are there.

- [**Merkel Tree**](./docs/bc_proto_merkel_tree.md) A data structure that is often used to store transactions/data within a blockchain, and which provides certain fast validation capabilities.

- [**The Consesus Algorithm**](./docs/bc_proto_consensus_algorithm.md) The distributed consensus algorithm  that ensures that all the nodes within a blockchain have a consisitent record of the data.

- [**Running Proto-Blockchain**](./docs/bc_proto_running_blockchain.md) Putting together all the components above to get a running proto-blockchain. Discussion of what its limitations are and where to go from here.

- [**Final Words**](./docs/bc_proto_final_words.md) Some final thoughts on the articles and where to go from here. 


All of the above are supported up by pseduocode implementation, and references to python implementation in this repo. 

It is recommended you read the above articles in sequence.
